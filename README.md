# Task List

A Task list application built during my apprenticeship at [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io).

## Technologies

HTML5 application built with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and using:
* [Angularjs](https://angularjs.org/)
* [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

## Features

* Persistent tasks, stored on firebase
* Tasks expire if not completed within one week
* Task can be created with a priority
* History of completed and expired tasks


## Quick start

Install:

1. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): `npm install -g grunt-cli`.

2. Install dependencies : `npm install`.

Run `grunt` to launch a local server you can then access on port 3000 of localhost.
